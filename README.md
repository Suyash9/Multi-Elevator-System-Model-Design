# Multi-Elevator-System-Model-Design
Designed a system controlling a Multi-elevator, containing multiple cabins in Event-B. There are two shafts and several cabins, and each cabin has a door. There are buttons for calling elevators (up, down) on the floors, and for specifying the floor (from inside the cabins) that the user wants to get off.
